# pytorch-foodvision-mini
Food image classification using deep learning with PyTorch. This project explores and compares the performance of two CNN architectures on a subset of the Food101 dataset, known as FoodVision Mini.

üîç Project Overview
The goal of this repository is to build a multi-class food image classifier capable of identifying various food items using:
TinyVGG: A custom convolutional neural network built from scratch, suitable for understanding CNN fundamentals and quick experimentation.
EfficientNet-B0: A state-of-the-art, pre-trained model known for achieving high accuracy with fewer parameters and computational resources.

üß† Key Features
End-to-end deep learning pipeline built with PyTorch.
Modular structure for easy extension and experimentation.

Includes:
Data loading and preprocessing,
Model training and evaluation,
Accuracy/loss visualization,
Sample prediction visualization,
Comparison of performance between a basic CNN (TinyVGG) and a powerful pretrained model (EfficientNet-B0).
